      <h2>About this Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        This is a <strong>school project prototype</strong> of a mental wellness
        assistant. It is designed for <strong>reflection</strong> and
        <strong>self-care ideas</strong>, not for diagnosis or treatment.
      </p>

      <h3>Important Disclaimer</h3>
      <p class="disclaimer">
        This assistant is <strong>not a therapist</strong>, does not give
        medical advice, and should not be used for emergencies. It cannot see,
        hear, or monitor you. It only responds to what you type.
      </p>

      <h3>Crisis & Safety</h3>
      <p>
        If you are in crisis, thinking about harming yourself or someone else,
        or feel unsafe:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call or text <strong>988</strong> in the U.S. for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.</li>
        <li>Call your local emergency number (such as <strong>911</strong>).</li>
        <li>Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or professional.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This prototype will try to detect some crisis language and redirect you
        to real-world support, but it is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for
        human help.
      </p>

      <h3>Suggested Use</h3>
      <p>
        You can use this assistant to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check in with your mood</li>
        <li>Reflect on your day or week</li>
        <li>Get gentle coping ideas and grounding exercises</li>
        <li>Clarify what you might want to talk about with a real person</li>
      </ul>
